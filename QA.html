        How do we Calculate our Aggregate?

          <strong>Here is the formula to calculating LASU aggregate üî• 

            The first thing is you divide your JAMB score by 8
            E.g 250√∑8= 31.25
            
            And for your o level grades here is how you grade them. 
            
            A1... 10 points 
            B2... 9 points 
            B3... 8 points 
            C4... 7 points 
            C5... 6 points 
            C6... 5 points 
            
            Now let's assume you scored 250 in JAMB and you have this o level result here üìå 
            
            Mathematics... B2  (8p) 
            English...         A1  (10p) 
            Physics...     A1  (10p) 
            Chemistry... B2  (8p) 
            Biology..   C4  (7p) 
            
            Now to get your final aggregate score  simply ADD YOUR JAMB AGGREGATE WITH YOUR O LEVEL AGGREGATE as we have it below üîΩ 
            
            31.25+8+10+10+8+7= 74.25
            
            Therefore, 74.25 will be your official admission screening aggregate. 
            
            And mind you, admission is based on general performance i.e the higher the aggregate the higher your chance of admission ‚úÖ

        LASU does not have a precise departmental cut off mark and this is because their admission is based on general performance. So, the higher your aggregate the higher your chance of securing  admission ahead of your peers.  This is why we have the merit list, supplementary list and the succeeding lists (called batches). Your admission is determined by the relevance of your aggregate.

        *Firstly* ............
        You'll have to get the screening form which comes out toark begining of another admission tussle in lasu. The form is just 2000 though service charge can increase it to like 2500. It's an online screening very easy to do and can be done on your phone or laptop though some aspirants often prefer to go to campus to do it or give it to consults to assist them. Anyway goes. 
        During the screening, you'll be uploading your olevel result,passport,and normal bio-data like name,state of origin,date of birth etc. 
        
        After this the next stage is the most palpitating stage it's the *ADMISSION STAGE* this is when you'll start seeing your admission on lasu portal. 
        After this state clearance and resumption....
        
        Kindly note that your olevel result is part of what makes up your aggregate so if you are writing waec of neco and the result isn't out yet it'll be better for you not to even attempt the admission at all to avoid low aggregate point though you can also go to Senate building to reupload your aggregate which seems impossible sometimes. 
        
        Nabteb result is lower than waec and neco!!!

        Now, after calculating your aggregate, it's possible that you might be thinking of the aggregate cutoff mark for your course. But lasu does not release cutoff for courses. So be it medicine,law, engineering, computer science, accounting, English, education or even fishery. The cut off remains 190 with a good olevel result but note that the higher your aggregate, the better your chances of been admitted into courses like accounting,mass communication, engineering, English,law, medicine etc.  You yourself after calculating your aggregate, you'll be able to denote if your aggregate matches the course you want to go for or not.
