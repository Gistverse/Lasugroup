Here is the formula to calculating LASU aggregate üî• 

The first thing is you divide your JAMB score by 8
E.g 250√∑8= 31.25

And for your o level grades here is how you grade them. 

A1... 10 points 
B2... 9 points 
B3... 8 points 
C4... 7 points 
C5... 6 points 
C6... 5 points 

Now let's assume you scored 250 in JAMB and you have this o level result here üìå 

Mathematics... B2  (8p) 
English...         A1  (10p) 
Physics...     A1  (10p) 
Chemistry... B2  (8p) 
Biology..   C4  (7p) 

Now to get your final aggregate score  simply ADD YOUR JAMB AGGREGATE WITH YOUR O LEVEL AGGREGATE as we have it below üîΩ 

31.25+8+10+10+8+7= 74.25

Therefore, 74.25 will be your official admission screening aggregate. 

And mind you, admission is based on general performance i.e the higher the aggregate the higher your chance of admission ‚úÖ




The difference is that 
Stream 1 is without entrepreneur , hence lower tuition fee. But before you should pick stream make sure your aggregate is HIGH‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è


Stream 2 is with entrepreneur in which you will learn any skills of your choice alongside your core course of study, so in the end, you will obtain two certificates..
If your aggregate is kinda low you can apply to stream 2 as it will boost your chance to get admission into your course of study ...


Pls courses under college of medicine doesn't have stream 2
Courses likeüëáüèº
Pharmacology
Physiology
Medicine and surgery
Nursing
Dentistry

No stream 2 for those, so before applying make sure ur agg is very okayüî•







LASU does not have a precise departmental cut off mark and this is because their admission is based on general performance. So, the higher your aggregate the higher your chance of securing  admission ahead of your peers.  This is why we have the merit list, supplementary list and the succeeding lists (called batches). Your admission is determined by the relevance of your aggregate. 

Additionally, indigenous candidates have about 20% chance in favor of them. For example, an Indigene with 70% aggregate may be admitted for a course a non indigene is unable to secure with a 74% aggregate. 

Also, your admission is not determined by your JAMB score only. A candidate with 192 may secure admission ahead of a candidate with 290 (know that). 

LASU conducts online screening not post UTME CBT (you must have a good o level result) And don't confuse UNILAG (post utme)  with LASU (screening). The former is a federal university while the later is state owned. 

You wanna study aeronautic and astronautic engineering, medicine and surgery, law, mechanical engineering, nursing, accounting, pharmacology (and the likes)???  be sure to have about 3 A's in your o level so as not to waste time and money on re-screening and "change of course"

LASU reserves the right to change your course and stream if you did not meet up with criteria before they attain their quota (quota is the number of students they want to take in for a particular course/department) 

And yes!  Both stream one and stream two new intakes pay 20k as acceptance fee and 10k as medical fee (as at last year)  BUT their school fees vary. 

STREAM ONE PAYS 58K
STREAM TWO PAYS 151K

STREAM TWO COMES WITH AN entrepreneurship STUDY WHILE STREAM ONE ISN'T. 

As a JAMB candidate you still have time to prepare. I know you guys are curious to know what's special about this stream two whatever and why they pay so high, well,  we are here to answer to your many questions. 

Good luck comrades!







[5/20, 15:36] +234 705 074 9767: Federal Government subsidises the fees that are paid by Students
[5/20, 15:37] +234 705 074 9767: That's why it appears so









So for those of you wanting to know what it looks like To do iivc. Well let me take you through the journey. 
Being an indigene of Lagos in Lasu has many advantage. And this made a lot of people who are not Lagos indigene to claim the state and in Lasu desire to curtail that, iivc was established. 
What's iivc? 
Lasu iivc is an interview conducted to verify that those claiming to be Lagos indigene are truly Lagos indigene. F
So let look at some of the documents that will be required from you 
1. Family landed property
2. Letter of recommendation from King
3. Letter of recognition from local govt. 
4. Receipt of payment of  iivc purchase form 
5. Passport etc.


So during the interview you'll be asked variety of questions ranging from name of your king to how to get to your village from your house, your family history,who your great grandfather was, occupation done in your area,big market in your area  etc. 
But note: before going you'll be required to fill in a form which I'll send immediately after this message. Thanks for reading. Have more questions?

*What is lasu screening and how is it done*

By now you'll have been told that lasu does not do post utme exam either written or cbt. I know a lot of us will be quite confused so I'll be writing this article to clear this doubt. Take a glass of water let's ride onüòÖ.

Lasu is a state University and does not have the kind of population applying for it unlike federal Universities like oau,unilag etc so in an attempt to meet up with the 3,500 students it admit yearly, they decided not to use post utme examination. Now the screening how does it go? 

 *Firstly* ............
You'll have to get the screening form which comes out toark begining of another admission tussle in lasu. The form is just 2000 though service charge can increase it to like 2500. It's an online screening very easy to do and can be done on your phone or laptop though some aspirants often prefer to go to campus to do it or give it to consults to assist them. Anyway goes. 
During the screening, you'll be uploading your olevel result,passport,and normal bio-data like name,state of origin,date of birth etc. 

After this the next stage is the most palpitating stage it's the *ADMISSION STAGE* this is when you'll start seeing your admission on lasu portal. 
After this state clearance and resumption....

Kindly note that your olevel result is part of what makes up your aggregate so if you are writing waec of neco and the result isn't out yet it'll be better for you not to even attempt the admission at all to avoid low aggregate point though you can also go to Senate building to reupload your aggregate which seems impossible sometimes. 

Nabteb result is lower than waec and neco!!!






Lasu, the best state University in Nigeria and 4th best University in Nigeria is a university that has its main campus at ojo but it has other campuses  like *engineering,agric, environment* at epe. 
 *Medicine* at ikeja etc. 

Students in this faculties/school will be moved to their exact campus after 100l though for medicine and aerospace engineering all students must be on 4.0 before they'll be allowed to transit. 

Does lasu write post utme exam? No!! I know a lot of us will be happy to hear that. Lasu does not write post utme but uses a new system called the screening process where your jamb result and olevel result will be used to calculate your aggregate.

Now, after calculating your aggregate, it's possible that you might be thinking of the aggregate cutoff mark for your course. But lasu does not release cutoff for courses. So be it medicine,law, engineering, computer science, accounting, English, education or even fishery. The cut off remains 190 with a good olevel result but note that the higher your aggregate, the better your chances of been admitted into courses like accounting,mass communication, engineering, English,law, medicine etc.  You yourself after calculating your aggregate, you'll be able to denote if your aggregate matches the course you want to go for or not. 

Lasu does not accept second choice .

Lasu does not accept jupeb from another institution or centre.

It's a must that every Lagos indigene seeking admission into lasu pass the iivc test.
